Now if you have just an English file (a file with only English characters) that is encoded using the above unicode scheme, we will actually use four times the space the file is. That is not so nice. To optimize this, there are several ways to encode Unicode code points into bits like UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32.I have discussed UTF-8 below."
